Make the changes to the code and tests and then commit to your branch. Be sure to follow the commit message conventions.

```

The Tag is one of the following:
* **Fix** - for a bug fix.
* **Update** - for a backwards-compatible enhancement.
* **Breaking** - for a backwards-incompatible enhancement.
* **Docs** - changes to documentation only.
* **Build** - changes to build process only.
* **New** - implemented a new feature.
* **Upgrade** - for a dependency upgrade.
* **Chore** - for tests, refactor, style, etc.

The message summary should be a one-sentence description of the change. The issue number should be mentioned at the end.
